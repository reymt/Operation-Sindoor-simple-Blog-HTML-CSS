      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Operation Sindoor</strong> stands as a historic milestone in
        India’s strategic and humanitarian response capabilities. Launched in
        early 2025, the operation was initiated in response to escalating
        tensions and humanitarian distress in a sensitive border region.
      </p>

      <h2>Strategic Deployment and Defense Excellence</h2>
      <p>
        The Indian Armed Forces executed Operation Sindoor with surgical
        precision. The deployment of the
        <strong>S-400 Triumf missile system</strong> played a critical role in
        air defense.

      />

      <p>
        <strong>INS Vikrant</strong>, India’s indigenous aircraft carrier,
        supported the mission by acting as a mobile base for air operations and
        logistics.

        temporary shelter. Air Force helicopters played a key role in
        extractions from high-risk zones.
      </p>

      <h2>Women Power in Uniform</h2>

      <h2>Technology and Coordination</h2>

        ISRO provided real-time data. AI-powered coordination and satellite
        imaging ensured safe and fast decisions on the battlefield and in
        humanitarian zones.
      </p>

      <h2>International Recognition and Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        Global organizations praised India’s operational excellence. The mission
